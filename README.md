```

## Repository size 
This repository is *heavy* (around 5.5Go); pulling it will take some time. 
It currently hosts the complete content of the website, including all images, both in the `src/` and `docs/` (output) folder. I do not offer a mirror corresponding to a boilerplate with minimal data (not sure how to do it correctly). The best way of using it right now is to navigate around on GitHub and pick whatever may be of value for you. 

## Eleventy version
This theme uses 11ty version 2. v3 is already out, but I didn't take the time to upgrade yet.
